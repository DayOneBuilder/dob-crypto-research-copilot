## The least noisy setup

### Codex

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DayOneBuilder/dob-crypto-research-copilot.git
cd dob-crypto-research-copilot
codex
```

Codex auto-discovers the repo-scoped skill from `.agents/skills/` when you launch Codex inside this repository.

This repo also ships:
- `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`
- `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`

So if you prefer Codex's plugin directory, you can load this repo as a local plugin source instead of copying files into your home directory.

### Claude Code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DayOneBuilder/dob-crypto-research-copilot.git
cd dob-crypto-research-copilot
claude --plugin-dir .
```

Claude Code loads the plugin from `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` when you launch it with `--plugin-dir .`.

## Optional personal install

If you want a standalone personal install outside the repo, use:

```bash
./install.sh
```

What it does:
- detects `~/.codex/skills` vs `~/.agents/skills` for Codex standalone installs
- installs the self-contained skill into the detected Codex location
- installs the same self-contained skill into `~/.claude/skills/`
- installs a helper launcher into `~/.local/bin/dob-crypto-research-copilot`

Personal uninstall:

```bash
./uninstall.sh
```

## Why this repo is structured this way

The product has to work in three ways without surprise:
1. **Repo-scoped Codex use** with no global writes
2. **Claude plugin use** with `--plugin-dir .`
3. **Optional standalone install** when you really want a personal global copy

To make that work, the skill is self-contained under `skills/dob-crypto-research-copilot/`. The helper script and any required files live with the skill instead of depending on a separate asset copy in `~/.dayonebuilder/`.

## Quick checks

Repo-local helper:

```bash
bin/scaffold-workspace.sh ./research/copilot
```

Standalone launcher after `./install.sh`:

```bash
~/.local/bin/dob-crypto-research-copilot --help
```
